``silkscreen``
--------------

The basic idea of [silkscreen](https://www.castlefineart.com/blog/all-about-silkscreens) is to use simulation based inference combined with [``artpop``](https://github.com/ArtificialStellarPopulations/ArtPop) to infer properties of dwarf galaxies directly from their images. The original goal was to accurately measure distances in the semi-resolved regime but it can also be used to infer metallicites and star-formation histories.
